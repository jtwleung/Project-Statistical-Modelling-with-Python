# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
- YELP results max out at 50, forcing me to split up categories (if I called all 9 categories per location, I would get much more than 50.  This forced me to combine into 6 categories)
- YELP limited to 500 calls per day (425 bike stations x 6 calls each with desired combos of categories) means I need 6 days to complete, and I only have 4 days
- Max out my YELP limit so forces me to drop some categories

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
- Does correlation change depending on breaking out different mobile rental companies (Vancouver Bike Share Inc., CycleHop LLC, City of Vancouver, Shaw Communications Inc., Fifteen) - go back and explore if can get this categorized data from citybikes to enrich dataset, and see
